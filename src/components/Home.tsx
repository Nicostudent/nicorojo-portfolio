      Hey there, I'm Nico. With nearly 2 years of experience in full stack
      development, I've honed my skills in JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
      Currently, I'm working with technologies such as React, TypeScript,
      PostgreSQL, and Prisma, and I'm expanding my knowledge by learning Java.
      I'm also immersed in learning React Native to broaden my expertise. Before
      transitioning into software development, I managed a successful hair
      salon, where I picked up some valuable customer service and management
      skills. Leveraging these diverse experiences, I'm now seeking full-time
      roles where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to
      advance my career in software development.

             where I learned a lot about coding.
            We focused on technologies like JavaScript, React, and Node.js, and it really took my skills to the next level. */}
      In my free time I like to climb, read and be in contact with nature.
